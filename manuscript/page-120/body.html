<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">an attack on Fresnoy-en-Gohelle. It was what we call a little brigade show.</p><p>Fresnoy was three miles from Vimy station. At daylight early on May the sixth, the bri gade went "over the top." The German barbed wire had all been cut by our artillery, so the Germans, anticipating the attack, met our brigade with a whole German division. This did not stop our brigade from advancing and closing with the enemy. In the little village of Fresnoy, though greatly outnumbered, they fought with the Huns for a whole day and night.</p><p>All the troops on both sides were wearing their gas helmets, and it was really a hand-to-hand struggle. Each one tried to tear the gas helmet from his opponent. A gas helmet pulled off a man meant his death, as the fumes were very thick. I later on spoke to an officer who participated in this fight and he told me of some of his experiences.</p></div> </div>
