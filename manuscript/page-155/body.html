Part of the instructions were that the men were to have their faces blackened and a small white chalk mark on the front of their steel helmets. On the back of each man was a small piece of bright tin about two inches in diameter, fastened on their tunic.</p><p>Notices had been sent to the units on our flanks that a raiding party was going out at one A.M.</p><p>Two hours' time was allowed us to accomplish this. I took my compass bearings and at one A.M. led the boys in single file through our barbed-wire entanglements into No Man's Land.</p><p>The German barbed-wire entanglements were about two hundred and fifty yards away from us. I headed right for where I estimated the  opening in the German wire entanglements would be.</p></div> </div>
